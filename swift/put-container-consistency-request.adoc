[.lead]
The PUT container consistency request allows you to specify the consistency level to apply to operations performed on a container. By default, new containers are created using the "`read-after-new-write`" consistency level.

== Request

[cols="2a,4a" options="header"]
|===
| Request HTTP Header| Description

m| X-Auth-Token
| The Swift authentication token for the account to use for the request.

m| x-ntap-sg-consistency
| The consistency control level to apply to operations on the container. The following values are supported:

*all*: All nodes receive the data immediately or the request will fail.

*strong-global*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites.

*strong-site*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.

*read-after-new-write*: (Default) Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Recommended for most cases.

*available*: Provides eventual consistency for both new objects and object updates. For S3 buckets, use only as required (for example, for a bucket that contains log values that are rarely read, or for HEAD or GET operations on keys that don't exist). Not supported for S3 FabricPool buckets.

m| Host
| The hostname to which the request is directed.

== How consistency controls and ILM rules interact to affect data protection

Both your choice of consistency control and your ILM rule affect how objects are protected. These settings can interact.

For example, the consistency control used when an object is stored affects the initial placement of object metadata, while the ingest behavior selected for the ILM rule affects the initial placement of object copies. Because StorageGRID requires access to both an object's metadata and its data to fulfill client requests, selecting matching levels of protection for the consistency level and ingest behavior can provide better initial data protection and more predictable system responses.

The following ingest behaviors are available for ILM rules:

* *Strict*: All copies specified in the ILM rule must be made before success is returned to the client.
* *Balanced*: StorageGRID attempts to make all copies specified in the ILM rule at ingest; if this is not possible, interim copies are made and success is returned to the client. The copies specified in the ILM rule are made when possible.
* *Dual Commit*: StorageGRID immediately makes interim copies of the object and returns success to the client. Copies specified in the ILM rule are made when possible.

NOTE: Before selecting the ingest behavior for an ILM rule, read the full description of these settings in the instructions for managing objects with information lifecycle management.

== Example of how consistency control and ILM rule can interact

Suppose you have a two-site grid with the following ILM rule and the following consistency level setting:

* *ILM rule*: Create two object copies, one at the local site and one at a remote site. The Strict ingest behavior is selected.
* *Consistency level*: "`strong-global`" (Object metadata is immediately distributed to all sites.)

When a client stores an object to the grid, StorageGRID makes both object copies and distributes metadata to both sites before returning success to the client.

The object is fully protected against loss at the time of the ingest successful message. For example, if the local site is lost shortly after ingest, copies of both the object data and the object metadata still exist at the remote site. The object is fully retrievable.

If you instead used the same ILM rule and the "`strong-site`" consistency level, the client might receive a success message after object data is replicated to the remote site but before object metadata is distributed there. In this case, the level of protection of object metadata does not match the level of protection for object data. If the local site is lost shortly after ingest, object metadata is lost. The object can't be retrieved.

The inter-relationship between consistency levels and ILM rules can be complex. Contact NetApp if you require assistance.
