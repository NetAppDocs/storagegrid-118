Consistency controls provide a balance between the availability of the objects and the consistency of those objects across different Storage Nodes and sites. The GET container consistency request allows you to determine the consistency level being applied to a particular container.

== Response

[cols="2a,4a" options="header"]
|===
| Response HTTP Header| Description
m| Date
| The date and time of the response.

m| Connection
| Whether the connection to the server is open or closed.

m| X-Trans-Id
| The unique transaction identifier for the request.

m| Content-Length
| The length of the response body.

m| x-ntap-sg-consistency
| The consistency control level being applied to the container. The following values are supported:

*all*: All nodes receive the data immediately or the request will fail.

*strong-global*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites.

*strong-site*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.

*read-after-new-write*: (Default) Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Recommended for most cases.

*available*: Provides eventual consistency for both new objects and object updates. For S3 buckets, use only as required (for example, for a bucket that contains log values that are rarely read, or for HEAD or GET operations on keys that don't exist). Not supported for S3 FabricPool buckets.
