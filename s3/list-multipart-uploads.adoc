[.lead]
The ListMultipartUploads operation lists in-progress multipart uploads for a bucket.

The following request parameters are supported:

* `encoding-type`
* `key-marker`
* `max-uploads`
* `prefix`
* `upload-id-marker`
* `Host`
* `Date`
* `Authorization`

== Versioning

Multipart upload consists of separate operations for initiating the upload, listing uploads, uploading parts, assembling the uploaded parts, and completing the upload. When the CompleteMultipartUpload operation is performed, that is the point when objects are created (and versioned if applicable).
