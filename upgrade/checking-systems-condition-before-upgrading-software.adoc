Before upgrading a StorageGRID system, you must verify the system is ready to accommodate the upgrade. You must ensure that the system is running normally and that all grid nodes are operational.

.Steps
. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
. Check for and resolve any active alerts.

. Confirm that no conflicting grid tasks are active or pending.
 .. Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*.
 .. Select *_site_* > *_primary Admin Node_* > *CMN* > *Grid Tasks* > *Configuration*.
+
Information lifecycle management evaluation (ILME) tasks are the only grid tasks that can run concurrently with the software upgrade.

 .. If any other grid tasks are active or pending, wait for them to finish or release their lock.
+
NOTE: Contact technical support if a task does not finish or release its lock.

. Refer to link:../network/internal-grid-node-communications.html[Internal grid node communications] and link:../network/external-communications.html[External communications] to ensure that all required ports for StorageGRID 11.7 are opened before you upgrade.
