StorageGRID 11.8 uses version 4 of the Grid Management API. Version 4 deprecates version 3; however, versions 1, 2, and 3 are still supported. 

IMPORTANT: You can continue to use deprecated versions of the management API with StorageGRID 11.8; however, support for these versions of the API will be removed in a future release of StorageGRID. After upgrading to StorageGRID 11.8, the deprecated APIs can be deactivated using the `PUT /grid/config/management` API.
