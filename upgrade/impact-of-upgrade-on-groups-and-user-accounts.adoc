| Permission | Description

| Tenant Manager > Manage objects with S3 Console
| When combined with the Manage all buckets permission, this permission allows users to access the link:../tenant/use-s3-console.html[Experimental S3 Console] from the Buckets page.

Users who have this permission but who don't have the Manage all buckets permission can still navigate directly to the Experimental S3 Console.
