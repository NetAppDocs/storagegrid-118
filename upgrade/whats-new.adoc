This release of StorageGRID introduces the following features and functional changes.

== New features


=== Lisa's new features
* S3 Console no longer experimental
* Assign policy to ILM tags. A tag can have no policy or one policy assigned to it, and there can be multiple tags that reference the same policy. The only way to "activate" a policy is for a tag to have that policy assigned to it.
* Configurable default consistency level


=== Kathy's new features
* Archive Nodes were deprecated in StorageGRID 11.7. You can now use the Decommission Nodes procedure to remove any unused Archive Nodes that are disconnected from the grid. See link:../maintain/decommissioning-disconnected-grid-nodes.html[Decommission disconnected grid nodes].

=== Kevin's new features

* The *Management API stack trace* option (*Configuration* > *Security settings*) lets you control whether a stack trace is returned in Grid Manager and Tenant Manager API error responses. See link:../admin/changing-browser-session-timeout-interface.html[Change interface security settings].
