[.lead]
This release of StorageGRID introduces the following features and functional changes.


== Install, upgrade, hotfix

Temporary installation passwords:: When you link:../vmware/deploying-storagegrid-node-as-virtual-machine.html[deploy a StorageGRID node as a virtual machine] or use VMware vSphere to link:../vmware/automating-grid-node-deployment-in-vmware-vsphere.html[automate grid node deployment], you are now prompted to set a temporary installation password. This password is used only if you need to access the VM console or use SSH before the new node joins the grid.


== Appliances

Documentation site for appliances:: The documentation for StorageGRID appliances was moved to a new link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-appliances/[appliances documentation site^].

FIPS support:: Support for FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography.

SGF6112 improvements:: StorageGRID 11.8 and StorageGRID Appliance Installer firmware version 3.8.0 support:
+
* Significantly improved PUT performance for new SGF6112 installations.
* UEFI secure boot on both upgraded and new SGF6112 nodes.
* Local key manager for DAS NVMe SSD drive passwords.


== Configure and manage

Consistency grid-wide default:: You can change the link:../s3/consistency-controls.html[grid-wide default consistency] using the Grid Manager or the grid-config endpoint of the link:../admin/using-grid-management-api.html[Grid Management private API]. The new default will be applied to buckets created after the change.

ILM policy tags:: Allows per-bucket ILM policies controlled with bucket tags. Multiple active and inactive ILM policies can exist at the same time. See link:../ilm/ilm-policy-overview.html[ILM policies:Overview].

Kafka endpoints:: Support for Kafka endpoints for link:../tenant/understanding-notifications-for-buckets.html[bucket event notifications].

Load balancer for management interface traffic:: Create load balancer endpoints to manage the management interface workload on Admin Nodes. See link:../admin/managing-load-balancing.html[considerations for load balancing]. As part of this change, you can now use Grid Manager and Tenant Manager ports 443, 8443, and 9443 when creating HTTPS load balancer endpoints for S3 or Swift client access. 

Manage drives tab:: Added link:../monitor/viewing-manage-drives-tab.html[Manage drives tab] for the SGF6112 appliance.

Metadata-only Storage Nodes:: You can now specify that a new link:../primer/what-storage-node-is.html#types-of-storage-nodes[software-based Storage Node] will be used to store only metadata instead of both objects and metadata.

SSO supports user principal names:: When link:../admin/configuring-sso.html[configuring single sign-on (SSO)] for Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) or PingFederate, you can now map the user principal name to `Name ID` in the claims rule or to `sAMAccountName=${username}` in the adapter instance.

TLS policy configuration and KMIP support:: 
+
* StorageGRID now supports either the TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 protocol for KMIP connections. See link:../admin/kms-considerations-and-requirements.html[Considerations and requirements for using a key management server].
* link:../admin/kms-configuring-storagegrid-as-client.html[Hashicorp is now fully supported for KMIP].
* Enhancements were made to link:../admin/manage-tls-ssh-policy.html[TLS policy configuration].


== Expand grid, maintain grid, recover or replace nodes

Account clone improvement:: Existing accounts can be cloned to a remote grid. See link:../admin/grid-federation-what-is-account-clone.html[What is account clone].

Archive Nodes can be decommissioned:: You can now use the Decommission Nodes procedure to remove any unused Archive Nodes that are disconnected from the grid. See link:../maintain/decommissioning-disconnected-grid-nodes.html[Decommission disconnected grid nodes].
+
NOTE: Archive Nodes were deprecated in StorageGRID 11.7. 

Automatic volume restoration:: Added a toggle for volume restoration to occur automatically. See link:../maintain/restoring-volume.html[Restore object data using Grid Manager].

Erasure coding, changes to configurations and rebalance procedure:: Improvements to erasure coding configurations.
+
Redistribute erasure-coded fragments among existing and new Storage Nodes. Recalculate the balance during maintenance tasks to provide better distribution when tasks are complete. See link:../expand/rebalancing-erasure-coded-data-after-adding-storage-nodes.html[Erasure coding rebalance procedure].

Management API stack trace:: The *Management API stack trace* security setting lets you control whether a stack trace is returned in Grid Manager and Tenant Manager API error responses. See link:../admin/changing-browser-session-timeout-interface.html[Change interface security settings].

Rolling reboot procedure:: You can now use the link:../maintain/rolling-reboot-procedure.html[rolling reboot procedure] to reboot multiple grid nodes without causing a service disruption.


== Grid Manager

Untrusted Client Networks, information about additional ports:: The Grid Manager list of ports open to the untrusted Client Network is now located in a column named, "Open to untrusted Client network" at *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *Load balancer endpoints* > *Management interface* (previously located on the Firewall control page). See link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[Configure load balancer endpoints].


== Tenant Manager

S3 Console no longer experimental:: Additional functionality described in link:../tenant/use-s3-console.html[Use S3 Console].

Tenant permission:: The link:../tenant/tenant-management-permissions.html[tenant management permission], View all buckets, has been added.


== S3 REST API

* link:../s3/changes-to-s3-rest-api-support.html[Changes to S3 REST API support].
* S3 delete markers with UUIDs. See link:../ilm/how-objects-are-deleted.html#delete-s3-versioned-objects[How objects are deleted] and link:../audit/sdel-s3-delete.html[SDEL: S3 DELETE].
* link:../s3/select-object-content.html[S3 Select ScanRange] is used when provided in requests for CSV and Parquet files.
