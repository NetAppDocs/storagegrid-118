[.lead]
This release of StorageGRID introduces the following features and functional changes.

== New features


=== Lisa's new features
* S3 Console no longer experimental
* Assign policy to ILM tags
* Can have multiple ILM policies active at one time

=== Configurable default consistency control
You can change the link:../s3/consistency-controls.html[grid-wide default consistency control]. To make the change, use the grid-config endpoint of the link:../admin/using-grid-management-api.html[Grid Management private API]. The new default will be applied to buckets created after the change.  

=== Kathy's new features
* Archive Nodes were deprecated in StorageGRID 11.7. You can now use the Decommission Nodes procedure to remove any unused Archive Nodes that are disconnected from the grid. See link:../maintain/decommissioning-disconnected-grid-nodes.html[Decommission disconnected grid nodes].

* When you link:../vmware/deploying-storagegrid-node-as-virtual-machine.html[deploy a StorageGRID node as a virtual machine] or use VMware vSphere to link:../vmware/automating-grid-node-deployment-in-vmware-vsphere.html[automate grid node deployment], you are now prompted to set a temporary installation password. This password is used only if you need to access the VM console or use SSH before the new node joins the grid.

* When configuring single sign-on (SSO) for Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) or PingFederate, you can now map the user principal name to `Name ID` in the claims rule or to `sAMAccountName=${username}` in the adapter instance.
