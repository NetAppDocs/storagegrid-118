Some features were removed or deprecated in this release. Review these items to understand whether you need to update client applications or modify your configuration before you upgrade.

Deprecated features might be removed beginning in N+2 major versions. For example, if a feature is deprecated in version N (for example, 6.3), the last version where the feature will exist is N+1 (for example, 6.4). Version N+2 (for example, 6.5) is the earliest that the feature removal will occur.

NOTE: In certain situations, NetApp might end support for particular features sooner than indicated.

== StorageGRID 11.8 end of feature support
