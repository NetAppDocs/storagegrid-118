StorageGRID provides logs that are used to capture events, diagnostic messages, and error conditions. You might be asked to collect log files and forward them to technical support to assist with troubleshooting.

The logs are categorized as follows:

* link:storagegrid-software-logs.html[StorageGRID software logs]
* link:deployment-and-maintenance-logs.html[Deployment and maintenance logs]
* link:logs-for-third-party-software.html[Logs for third-party software]
* link:about-bycast-log.html[About the bycast.log]

IMPORTANT: The details provided for each log type are for reference only. The logs are intended for advanced troubleshooting by technical support. Advanced techniques that involve reconstructing the problem history using the audit logs and the application log files are beyond the scope of these instructions.

== Access the logs

To access the logs, you can link:collecting-log-files-and-system-data.html[collect log files and system data] from one or more nodes as a single log file archive. Or, if the primary Admin Node is unavailable or unable to reach a specific node, you can access individual log files for each grid node as follows:

. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@grid_node_IP`
. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

== Log file categories

The StorageGRID log file archive contains the logs described for each category and additional files that contain metrics and debug command output.
