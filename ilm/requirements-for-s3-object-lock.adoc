You must review the requirements for enabling the global S3 Object Lock setting, the requirements for creating compliant ILM rules and ILM policies, and the restrictions StorageGRID places on buckets and objects that use S3 Object Lock.

== Requirements for using the global S3 Object Lock setting

* You must enable the global S3 Object Lock setting using the Grid Manager or the Grid Management API before any S3 tenant can create a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled.
* Enabling the global S3 Object Lock setting allows all S3 tenant accounts to create buckets with S3 Object Lock enabled.
* After you enable the global S3 Object Lock setting, you can't disable the setting.
* You can't enable the global S3 Object Lock unless the default rule in the active ILM policy is _compliant_ (that is, the default rule must comply with the requirements of buckets with S3 Object Lock enabled).
* When the global S3 Object Lock setting is enabled, you can't create a new proposed ILM policy or activate an existing proposed ILM policy unless the default rule in the policy is compliant. After the global S3 Object Lock setting has been enabled, the ILM rules and ILM policies pages indicate which ILM rules are compliant.

== Requirements for compliant ILM rules

If you want to enable the global S3 Object Lock setting, you must ensure that the default rule in your active ILM policy is compliant. A compliant rule satisfies the requirements of both buckets with S3 Object Lock enabled and any existing buckets that have legacy Compliance enabled:

* It must create at least two replicated object copies or one erasure-coded copy.
* These copies must exist on Storage Nodes for the entire duration of each line in the placement instructions.
* Object copies can't be saved in a Cloud Storage Pool.
* Object copies can't be saved on Archive Nodes.
* At least one line of the placement instructions must start at day 0, using *Ingest time* as the reference time.
* At least one line of the placement instructions must be "`forever.`"

== Requirements for active and proposed ILM policies

When the global S3 Object Lock setting is enabled, active and proposed ILM policies can include both compliant and non-compliant rules.

* The default rule in the active or any proposed ILM policy must be compliant.
* Non-compliant rules only apply to objects in buckets that don't have S3 Object Lock enabled or that don't have the legacy Compliance feature enabled.
* Compliant rules can apply to objects in any bucket; S3 Object Lock or legacy Compliance does not need to be enabled for the bucket.

A compliant ILM policy might include these three rules:

. A compliant rule that creates erasure-coded copies of the objects in a specific bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. The EC copies are stored on Storage Nodes from day 0 to forever.
. A non-compliant rule that creates two replicated object copies on Storage Nodes for a year and then moves one object copy to Archive Nodes and stores that copy forever. This rule only applies to buckets that don't have S3 Object Lock or legacy Compliance enabled because it stores only one object copy forever and it uses Archive Nodes.
. A default, compliant rule that creates two replicated object copies on Storage Nodes from day 0 to forever. This rule applies to any object in any bucket that was not filtered out by the first two rules.
