[.lead]
You can perform a rolling reboot to reboot multiple grid nodes without causing a service disruption. 

.Before you begin

* From the *primary Admin Node*, you are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
+
NOTE: You can monitor the rolling reboot procedure from any Admin Node, but you must be signed in to the primary Admin Node to start this procedure. 

* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[Maintenance or Root access permission].

.About this task
Use this procedure if you need to reboot multiple StorageGRID nodes at the same time. 

For example, you might need to use this procedure if you change the FIPS mode for the grid's link:../admin/manage-tls-ssh-policy.html[TLS and SSH security policy]. When the FIPS mode changes, you must reboot all nodes to put the change into effect.

TIP: If you only need to reboot one node, you can link:../monitor/using-task-tab-to-reboot-grid-node.html[use the Tasks tab on the Nodes page].

When StorageGRID reboots a grid node, it issues the reboot command on the node, which causes the node to shut down and restart. All services are restarted automatically. 

The rolling reboot procedure reboots multiple nodes at the same time, with these exceptions:

* Two nodes of the same type will not be rebooted at the same time.
* Gateway Nodes and Admin Nodes will not be rebooted  at the same time.
* Storage Nodes and Archive Nodes will not be rebooted at the same time.

Instead, these nodes are rebooted sequentially to ensure that HA groups, object data, and critical node services always remain available. 

Using rolling reboot for the primary Admin Node::
When you reboot the primary Admin Node, your browser temporarily loses access to the Grid Manager, so you can no longer monitor the procedure. For this reason, the primary Admin Node is rebooted last.

Using rolling reboot for Storage Nodes:: If you plan to reboot one or more Storage Nodes and any ILM rule uses the *Dual commit* ingest option (or the rule specifies *Balanced* and it is not possible to immediately create all required copies), StorageGRID immediately commits any newly ingested objects to two Storage Nodes on the same site and evaluates ILM later. If you reboot two or more Storage Nodes at a given site, you might not be able to access these objects for the duration of the reboot.

== Perform a rolling reboot 
You select the nodes you want to reboot, review your selections, start the reboot procedure, and monitor the progress.

=== Select nodes

As your first step, access the Rolling reboot page and select the nodes you want to reboot.

.Steps

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Rolling reboot*.

. Review the connection state and alert icons in the *Node name* column.
+
TIP: You can't reboot a node if it is disconnected from the grid. The check boxes are disabled for nodes with these icons: image:../media/icon_alarm_gray_administratively_down.png[gray question mark icon] or  image:../media/icon_alarm_blue_unknown.png[blue question mark icon].

. If any nodes have active alerts, review the list of alerts in the *Alert summary* column.
+
TIP: To see all current alerts for a node, you can also select the link:../monitor/viewing-overview-tab.html[Nodes > Overview tab].

. If possible, review the recommended actions for any current alerts and perform the prerequisite steps.
+
TIP: For some alerts, you must perform a number of steps before you reboot the node. 

. Optionally, if all nodes are connected and you want to reboot all of them, select the check box in the table header and select *Select all*. Otherwise, select each node you want to reboot.
+
You can use the table's filter options to view subsets of nodes. For example, you can view and select only Storage Nodes or all nodes at a certain site.

. Select *Review selection*. 

=== Review selection

In this step, you can determine how long the total reboot procedure might take and confirm that you selected the correct nodes.

. On the Review selection page, review the Summary, which indicates how many nodes will be rebooted and the estimated total time for all nodes to reboot.

. Optionally, to remove a specific node from the reboot list, select *Remove*. 

. Optionally, to add more nodes, select  *Previous step*, select the additional nodes, and select *Review selection*.

. When you are ready to start the rolling reboot procedure for all selected nodes, select *Reboot nodes*.

. If you selected to reboot the primary Admin Node, read the information message, and select *Yes*. 
+
NOTE: The primary Admin Node will be the last node to reboot. While this node is rebooting, your browser's connection will be lost. When the primary Admin Node is available again, you must reload the Rolling reboot page. 

=== Monitor a rolling reboot
While the rolling reboot procedure is running, you can monitor it from any Admin Node.

.Steps

. Review the overall progress of the operation, which includes the following information:

** Number of nodes rebooted
** Number of nodes that failed the reboot operation
** Number of nodes in process of being rebooted
** Number of nodes that remain to be rebooted

. Review the table for each type of node.
+
The tables provide a progress bar of the operation on each node and show the reboot stage for that node, which can be one of these:

* Not started
* Stopping services
* Rebooting system
* Starting services
* Completed

== Stop the rolling reboot procedure
You can stop the rolling reboot procedure from any Admin Node. When you stop the procedure, any nodes that have the status "`Stopping services,`" "`Rebooting system,`" or "`Starting services`" will complete the reboot operation. However, these nodes will no longer be tracked as part of the procedure. 

.Steps

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Rolling reboot*.
. From the *Monitor reboot* step, select *Stop reboot*.
