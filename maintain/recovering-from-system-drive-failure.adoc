If the system drive on a software-based Storage Node has failed, the Storage Node is not available to the StorageGRID system. You must complete a specific set of tasks to recover from a system drive failure.

Use this procedure to recover from a system drive failure on a software-based Storage Node. This procedure includes the steps to follow if any storage volumes also failed or can't be remounted.

NOTE: This procedure applies to software-based Storage Nodes only. You must follow a different procedure to link:recovering-storagegrid-appliance-storage-node.html[recover an appliance Storage Node].
