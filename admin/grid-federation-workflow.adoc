As a grid administrator, you must coordinate closely with tenant users to establish and use a grid federation connection between two StorageGRID systems for account clone and cross-grid replication.

The workflow diagram shows the high-level steps that grid administrators and tenant users will perform to establish a grid federation connection between two grids and to set up account clone and cross-grid replication. 

After creating a grid federation connection between two grids, the grid administrator creates one or more new tenant accounts and assigns a permission to determine who can use the connection. When the new tenant is saved, StorageGRID automatically creates an identical tenant on the other grid.

After the new tenant is available on both grids, tenant users can perform these operations:

** From the tenant's source grid, create new tenant users and groups, which are automatically cloned to the tenant's destination grid.
** From the tenant's source grid, create new S3 access keys, which can be optionally cloned to the tenant's destination grid.
** Create new buckets on both grids and optionally enable cross-grid replication in one direction or both directions.
