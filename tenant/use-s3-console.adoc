You can use S3 Console to view the objects in an S3 bucket.

You can also use S3 Console to do the following:

* Add and delete objects, object versions, and folders
* Rename objects
* Move and copy objects between buckets and folders
* Manage object tags
* View object metadata
* Download objects

NOTE: Tenants should only use S3 Console when performing functions for a small number of objects, such as when uploading objects to simulate a new ILM policy, troubleshooting ingest issues, or using proof-of-concept or non-production grids.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the Root access permission or that has both the Manage all buckets and Manage objects with S3 Console link:tenant-management-permissions.html[permissions].
* You have created a bucket.
* An S3 Group or Bucket policy has been configured for the user.
* You know the user's access key ID and secret access key. Optionally, you have a `.csv` file containing this information. See the link:creating-your-own-s3-access-keys.html[instructions for creating access keys].

.Steps

. Select *STORAGE* > *Buckets* > *_bucket name_*.
. Select the S3 Console tab.
. Paste the access key ID and secret access key into the fields. Otherwise, select *Upload access keys* and select your `.csv` file.
. Select *Sign in*.
. The Buckets page appears. You can manage objects as needed:
+
* Select a bucket name to view the objects in a bucket.
* Search for objects or folders.
* Organize objects into folders. Select *New folder* to create a folder, then cut or copy and paste objects to the new folder.
* Download objects or folders.
* Rename objects or folders.
* Delete objects or folders.
